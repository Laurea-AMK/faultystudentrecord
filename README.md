# :wave: The Basics of GitHub 

## ðŸ¤“ Learning outcomes 

Thourgh this group work, you will learn how to read code, search and report security vulnarabilities and fix some of them. ðŸš€

## ðŸ¤“ Learning outcomes 

Faultystudentrecord is a tiny program with-text based user inteface, which allows one the store basic information on students.  There are many serious  flaws and vulnarabilities in the program. You will practice finding, reporting and  and fixing them.

## ðŸ¤“ Preparation steps

1. Creare a new repository for your team based on this templete called "faultystudentrecord".  See instructions at [GitHub Docs: Creating a repository from a template] (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Enable security vulnararibilities reporting for your repository. See instructions at  [GitHub Docs: Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository] (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)
3.  Create a branch (a copy) of the main code called "lessfaultystudentrecord". See instructions: [GitHub Docs: Creating and deleting branches in your repository] https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository

## :octocat: Work steps

1.  Examine the code carefully and test diffifferent (honest and dishonest) usage scenarious.  For finding issues that are more difficult to spot, search online for information about  "SQL injection" and "Directory Travesal".  
2.  As soon as you find security flaws, use GitHub to file a Security Vulnarabilities Report. Use this templete as a basis of your vulnability report: Vulnarability Report Templete (https://github.com/github/securitylab/blob/main/docs/report-template.md).  The text-based report does not have mandatory fields, but you should provide as much information as possible.  It is particularly important to provide exact steps to reproduce the vulnarablity (in this case, this means, 
tested example code on how an attacker could use this fulnarability).  There must be a seperate report for each vulnability found.
3. If you still have time, try fixing some of your security vulnarabilties.  Do not change the code in the main repository directly, but make changes to the branch called "lessfaultystudentrecord".  If you edit the code with GitHub Copilot, it may also help you spot new security vulnarabilities.  If so, please report them in accordance with instructions in step 2.
