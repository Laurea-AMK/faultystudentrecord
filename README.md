# Security Vulnerabilities Reporting

## Learning goals

Thourgh this group work, you will learn how to read code, search and report security vulnarabilities and fix some of them. ðŸš€

## Backgroud 

Faultystudentrecord is a tiny program with-text based user inteface, which allows one the store basic information on students.  There are many serious  flaws and vulnarabilities in the program. You will practice finding, reporting and  and fixing them.  Please read more background information (including assessment criteria) in Canvas.

## Preparation steps

1. Creare a new repository for your team based on this templete called "faultystudentrecord".  See instructions at [GitHub Docs: Creating a repository from a template] (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. Enable security  vulnerabilities reporting for your repository. See instructions at  [GitHub Docs: Configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository] (https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository)
3.  Create a branch (a copy) of the main code called "lessfaultystudentrecord". See instructions: [GitHub Docs: Creating and deleting branches in your repository] https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository

## Work steps

1.  Examine the code carefully and test different (honest and dishonest) usage scenarous.  For finding issues that are more difficult to spot, search online for information about  "SQL injection" and "Directory Traversal".  
2.  As soon as you find security flaws, use GitHub to file a Security Vulnarabilities Report. Use this template as a basis of your vulnability report: [Vulnerability Report Templete by GitHub Security Lab] (https://github.com/github/securitylab/blob/main/docs/report-template.md).  The text-based report does not have mandatory fields, but you should provide as much information as possible.  It is particularly important to provide exact steps to reproduce the vulnerablity (in this case,  tested example code on how an attacker could use it).  There must be a seperate report for each vulnerability found.
3. If you still have time, try fixing some of the found security  vulnerabilities.  Do not change the code in the main repository directly, but make changes to the branch called "lessfaultystudentrecord". Make sure to commit all your changes to the code. If you edit the code with GitHub Copilot, it may also help you spot new security  flaws.  If so, please test them and report them in accordance with instructions in step 2.
    
## Submit and present
1. Submit the link to your main repository in Canvas and make a 10-minute presentatation (see Canvas for more instructions).
